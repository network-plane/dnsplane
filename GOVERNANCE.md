# Governance

This document defines how the dnsplane project is governed: who makes decisions, how they are made, and the main roles.

## Roles

- **Maintainer(s)**  
  Have write access to the repository and are responsible for reviewing and merging pull requests, cutting releases, and steering the project. They make final decisions on code, documentation, and process within this repo.  
  Current maintainer(s) are listed in the [README](../README.md#authors).

- **Contributors**  
  Anyone who submits patches, pull requests, issues, or documentation improvements. Contributors do not have write access; they participate by opening issues and pull requests and by following the [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) guidelines.

## Decision-making

- **Code and documentation**  
  Changes are proposed via pull requests. A maintainer reviews and merges (or requests changes). For non-trivial changes, the maintainer may leave the PR open for comment before merging. There is no formal voting; the maintainer(s) decide based on project goals, quality, and maintainability.

- **Releases**  
  Maintainers decide when to tag a release and what goes into release notes. Version numbering follows semantic versioning where applicable.

- **Process and policy**  
  Updates to governance, contributing guidelines, code of conduct, or security policy are made via pull requests and merged by a maintainer. For substantial changes, the maintainer may open an issue first to discuss.

- **Disputes and conduct**  
  Disagreements about technical or community matters should be resolved in a respectful way. The [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies; violations may be reported as described there, and community leaders (maintainers) will address them.

## Adding or changing maintainers

If the project grows, maintainers may invite additional maintainers by consensus of existing maintainers and by granting repository write access. This document may be updated via a pull request to reflect any change in roles.
