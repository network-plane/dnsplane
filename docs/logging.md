# Logging

**DNS structured logs (debug):** When `log_severity` is `debug` (or lower) and the DNS log file is enabled, each resolved query is logged asynchronously with **`dns query`** and fields: `qname`, `qtype`, `outcome` (`local` \| `cache` \| `upstream` \| `none` \| `blocked`), `upstream` (address:port when `outcome` is `upstream`, else empty), `duration_ms`.

**Server:** Logging is configured in `dnsplane.json` under a `log` section. By default logs are written to `/var/log/dnsplane/` with fixed filenames: `dnsserver.log`, `apiserver.log`, and `tuiserver.log`. You can set:

- `log_dir` – directory for log files (default: `/var/log/dnsplane`)
- `log_severity` – minimum level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error`; or `none` to disable logging (no log files are created). Default is `none`.
- `log_rotation` – `none`, `size`, or `time`
- `log_rotation_size_mb` – max size in MB before rotation (when rotation is `size`)
- `log_rotation_time_days` – max age in days before rotation (when rotation is `time`)

Rotation is checked at most every 5 minutes to avoid repeated stat calls. If writing to a log file fails, the process keeps running and the message is written to stderr.

**Client:** File logging is off by default. Use `--log-file` to enable it; you can pass a file path or a directory (in which case the file is named `dnsplaneclient.log`).
